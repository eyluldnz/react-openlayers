# Openlayers with React Personel Web Application

### In this application, it is for marking on the map which of the events attended by people in Turkey are in real life and which are in the virtual environment. My work on this project continues.

## To Do:

* The user initiates an interaction on the map and provides access to the features of the city she clicks.
* Creating a modal for the user after marking on the map
* Making the home page of the application
* Integrating Firebase to keep data in the app on a server side


## Technologies and libraries

* React.js
* Bootstrap
* context-api
* react-router-dom
* styled-components
* Firebase
* Openlayers.js
